Here are some of my take aways from [Eric Sowell's](href="http://ericsowell.com/") presentation at the [Dallas Tech Fest](href="http://dallastechfest.com/")

+Semantic markup makes reading html simpler

+Modernizer of Html5Shim make older browsers work with semantic tags

+Using a &#8220;css reset&#8221; can save you lots of grief and frustration

The css reset Eric used came from Eric Meyer&#8217;s site. I&#8217;ve seen similar settings in the Blueprint Css style sheets.

I aslo heard the phrase &#8220;In general, you should be more specific&#8221;. That sounds rather odd, but given a context of trying to cascade styles to UI elements, it makes more sense. When you can be more specific with your selectors, you will be less surprised by the result.

For additional resources for learning about Css, Eric suggested books by Zeldman, Marcotte, Cederholm and Meyer.
